## 5. Advanced Search Techniques

### Custom Search Strategies

#### Boolean Search Operations
**Advanced Keyword Combinations**
Property Income Finder supports sophisticated search logic using Boolean operators to create precise search queries.

**AND Operations**
Combine multiple requirements that must all be present:
```
"ADU" AND "garage" AND "large lot"
```
This finds properties with all three features: ADU potential, garage, and large lot.

**OR Operations**
Find properties with any of the specified criteria:
```
"duplex" OR "triplex" OR "fourplex"
```
This searches for any multi-family property type.

**NOT Operations**
Exclude unwanted features or conditions:
```
"rental property" NOT "HOA" NOT "condo"
```
This finds rental properties while excluding HOA properties and condos.

**Complex Combinations**
Create sophisticated search logic:
```
("ADU" OR "in-law suite") AND "separate entrance" NOT "mobile home"
```

#### Geographic Search Mastery

**Multi-Market Search Strategy**
1. **Primary Market Definition**
   - Define 3-5 primary investment markets

   - **Tight Radius (1-3 miles)**: Focus on specific neighborhoods
   - **Medium Radius (5-10 miles)**: Suburban market coverage
   - **Wide Radius (15-25 miles)**: Regional opportunity identification

3. **Custom Boundary Drawing**
   - Use map tools to draw precise search areas
   - Exclude specific neighborhoods or include only desired areas
   - Save custom boundaries for repeated searches
