## 6. Advanced Search Techniques {#advanced-search}

### Boolean Search Operations
Master complex search queries using Boolean logic to find exactly what you're looking for.

#### Basic Boolean Operators

**AND Operator**: Find properties that meet multiple criteria
```
Search: "Seattle AND duplex AND under 500000"
Result: Duplexes in Seattle under $500,000
```

**OR Operator**: Expand search to include alternatives
```
Search: "Portland OR Vancouver OR Tacoma"
Result: Properties in any of these three cities
```

**NOT Operator**: Exclude unwanted results
```
Search: "investment property NOT condo"
Result: Investment properties excluding condominiums
```

#### Advanced Boolean Examples

**Complex Multi-Criteria Search:**
```json
{
  "query": "(Seattle OR Bellevue) AND (duplex OR triplex) AND price:<600000 AND built:>1980",
  "filters": {
    "cashFlow": ">500",
    "capRate": ">6",
    "walkScore": ">70"
  }
}
```

**Neighborhood-Specific Searches:**
```json
{
  "query": "neighborhood:(Capitol Hill OR Fremont OR Ballard) AND bedrooms:>=3 AND garage:true",
  "strategy": "house_hacking",
  "maxPrice": 750000
}
```

### Geographic Search Mastery

#### Radius-Based Searches
Find properties within specific distances from key locations:

**Example: Properties Near Transit**
```json
{
  "centerPoint": "University of Washington Station",
  "radius": "1 mile",
  "propertyType": "condo",
  "transitScore": ">80"
}
```

**Example: Employment Center Proximity**
```json
{
  "centerPoint": "Amazon HQ, Seattle",
  "radius": "30 minutes commute",
  "transportMode": "public_transit",
  "priceRange": {
    "min": 300000,
    "max": 600000
  }
}
```

#### Polygon Search Areas
Define custom search boundaries:

```javascript
// Define search polygon for specific neighborhoods
const searchPolygon = {
  "type": "Polygon",
  "coordinates": [[
    [-122.3328, 47.6061], // Downtown Seattle
    [-122.3286, 47.6205], // Capitol Hill
    [-122.3542, 47.6205], // Queen Anne
    [-122.3542, 47.6061], // Belltown
    [-122.3328, 47.6061]  // Close polygon
  ]]
};
```

### Time-Based Search Strategies

  "daysOnMarket": {
    "min": 30,
    "max": 90,
    "reasoning": "Motivated sellers, negotiation opportunity"
  },
  "priceReductions": ">1",
  "listingHistory": "analyze_previous_attempts"

#### 1031 Exchange Strategies
Defer capital gains through like-kind exchanges:

**1031 Exchange Timeline:**
```
Day 1: Close on sale of relinquished property

• Equal or greater value
• Equal or greater debt
• Use qualified intermediary
```

**Exchange Example:**
```
Relinquished Property:
• Sale Price: $600,000
• Original Basis: $400,000
• Capital Gain: $200,000
• Deferred Tax (20% + 3.8%): $47,600

Replacement Property:
• Purchase Price: $750,000
• New Basis: $550,000 ($400,000 + $150,000 additional investment)
• Deferred Gain: $200,000
```
