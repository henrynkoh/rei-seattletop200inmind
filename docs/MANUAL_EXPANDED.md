## 4. Investment Strategies

### ADU (Accessory Dwelling Unit) Investment Strategy

#### Understanding ADU Opportunities
**What are ADUs?**
Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs) are secondary housing units on single-family residential lots. They provide an excellent opportunity for generating additional rental income while maintaining the primary residence.

**Types of ADUs**
1. **Detached ADUs**: Separate structures like converted garages or new construction
2. **Attached ADUs**: Additions to existing homes with separate entrances
3. **Internal ADUs**: Converted basements, attics, or portions of existing homes
4. **Junior ADUs**: Smaller units (typically under 500 sq ft) within existing homes

#### ADU Investment Analysis Framework
**Property Identification Criteria**
- **Lot Size**: Minimum lot size requirements for ADU construction
- **Zoning Compliance**: Areas where ADUs are permitted by local regulations
- **Existing Structures**: Properties with garages, basements, or large lots
- **Utility Access**: Availability of separate utility connections
- **Parking Requirements**: Adequate parking for both units

**Financial Analysis Components**
1. **Construction Costs**
   - **Detached ADU**: $150,000 - $400,000 depending on size and finishes
   - **Garage Conversion**: $80,000 - $200,000 for basic to luxury finishes
   - **Basement Conversion**: $50,000 - $150,000 depending on existing conditions
   - **Permits and Fees**: $5,000 - $25,000 for planning and building permits

2. **Revenue Projections**

   - **Rent Growth**: Annual rent increase potential (typically 3-5%)
   - **Additional Income**: Parking, storage, or utility income opportunities

3. **ROI Calculations**
   - **Total Investment**: Property purchase + ADU construction costs
   - **Annual Net Income**: Gross rental income - operating expenses
   - **Cash-on-Cash Return**: Annual cash flow / total cash invested
   - **Appreciation Potential**: Property value increase from ADU addition

### House Hacking Strategy

#### House Hacking Fundamentals
**What is House Hacking?**
House hacking involves purchasing a multi-unit property, living in one unit, and renting out the others to offset mortgage payments and living expenses.

**House Hacking Benefits**
- **Reduced Living Expenses**: Rental income covers mortgage payments
- **Owner-Occupant Financing**: Access to lower down payment loans (FHA, VA)
- **Real Estate Experience**: Learn property management while living on-site
- **Forced Savings**: Build equity while living affordably
- **Tax Advantages**: Depreciation and expense deductions on rental portions

#### House Hacking Property Types
1. **Traditional Duplex/Triplex/Fourplex**
   - Live in one unit, rent others
   - Separate entrances and utilities preferred
   - Good for beginners with residential financing

2. **Single-Family with ADU**
   - Live in main house, rent ADU
   - More privacy than multi-unit properties
   - Potential for future ADU development

3. **Large Single-Family with Roommates**
   - Rent individual rooms to roommates
   - Shared common areas and utilities
   - Higher management intensity but potentially higher returns

4. **Live-in Flip Properties**
   - Purchase fixer-upper, renovate while living there
   - Sell after 2+ years for capital gains tax benefits
   - Combine house hacking with fix-and-flip strategy

#### House Hacking Financial Analysis
**Financing Considerations**
1. **Owner-Occupant Loans**
   - **FHA Loans**: 3.5% down payment, up to 4 units
   - **VA Loans**: 0% down payment for qualified veterans
   - **Conventional Loans**: 5-10% down payment, better rates
   - **USDA Loans**: 0% down in rural areas

2. **Income Qualification**
   - **Rental Income Credit**: 75% of projected rental income counts toward qualification
   - **Debt-to-Income Ratios**: Total monthly debts / gross monthly income
   - **Reserve Requirements**: 2-6 months of mortgage payments in savings

**Cash Flow Analysis**
```
Monthly Income:
+ Rental Income (Unit 2): $1,500
+ Rental Income (Unit 3): $1,400
= Total Rental Income: $2,900

Monthly Expenses:
- Mortgage Payment (PITI): $2,200
- Property Management: $145 (5% of rental income)
- Maintenance Reserve: $200
- Vacancy Reserve: $145 (5% of rental income)
= Total Expenses: $2,690

Net Cash Flow: $210/month
Effective Housing Cost: $2,200 - $2,900 = -$700 (you get paid to live there!)
```
