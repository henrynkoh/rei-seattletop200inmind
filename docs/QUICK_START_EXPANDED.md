## 1. Pre-Launch Checklist {#pre-launch-checklist}

### Financial Preparation
Before diving into property searches, ensure you have your finances in order:

**Credit Score Assessment:**
- Check your credit score (aim for 740+ for best rates)
- Review credit report for errors
- Pay down high-balance credit cards
- Avoid new credit applications before property purchase

**Down Payment Planning:**
```
Investment Property Down Payment Requirements:
• Conventional Loans: 20-25% minimum
• Portfolio Lenders: 15-20% (for experienced investors)
• Hard Money: 10-15% (short-term, higher rates)
• Cash Purchases: 100% (best negotiating position)

Example for $500,000 property:
• 20% Down: $100,000 + $15,000 closing costs = $115,000 total
• 25% Down: $125,000 + $15,000 closing costs = $140,000 total
```

**Income Documentation:**
Gather these documents for loan pre-approval:
- Last 2 years of tax returns
- Recent pay stubs (if W-2 employee)
- Bank statements (last 3 months)
- Investment account statements
- Existing rental property documentation
- Business financial statements (if self-employed)

**Reserve Requirements:**
Maintain adequate cash reserves:
- 2-6 months of mortgage payments per property
- $5,000-10,000 for unexpected repairs
- Additional funds for next property down payment

### Market Research Preparation

**Target Market Selection:**
Choose 2-3 markets to focus on initially:

**Primary Market Criteria:**
- Population growth: >1% annually
- Job growth: >2% annually
- Median home price: Affordable for your budget
- Landlord-friendly laws
- Strong rental demand

**Example Market Analysis:**
```
Seattle Metro Market Profile:
✓ Population Growth: +1.8% annually
✓ Job Growth: +2.4% annually
✓ Median Home Price: $825,000
✓ Rental Yield: 4.2-6.8%
✓ Landlord Laws: Moderate (some restrictions)
✓ Rental Demand: High (65% renters in urban core)

Investment Verdict: Strong market for appreciation,
moderate for cash flow due to high prices.
```

## 5. Understanding Investment Analysis {#investment-analysis}

### Financial Metrics Explained

**Cash Flow Analysis:**
Cash flow is the monthly income after all expenses:

```
Monthly Cash Flow Calculation:
Gross Rental Income:           $3,200
Less: Vacancy (5%):             -$160
Net Rental Income:             $3,040

Monthly Expenses:
• Mortgage Payment:            $3,160
• Property Taxes:               $520
• Insurance:                    $125
• Property Management (10%):    $304
• Maintenance (8%):             $256
• Total Expenses:             $4,365

Monthly Cash Flow: $3,040 - $4,365 = -$1,325
```

**Return on Investment (ROI) Metrics:**

**1. Cap Rate (Capitalization Rate):**
```
Cap Rate = Net Operating Income / Property Value
NOI = $3,040 × 12 - $520 × 12 - $125 × 12 - $304 × 12 - $256 × 12
NOI = $36,480 - $6,240 - $1,500 - $3,648 - $3,072 = $22,020
Cap Rate = $22,020 / $625,000 = 3.5%
```

**2. Cash-on-Cash Return:**
```
Cash-on-Cash = Annual Cash Flow / Total Cash Invested
Annual Cash Flow = -$1,325 × 12 = -$15,900
Total Cash Invested = $125,000 (down payment) + $15,000 (closing costs) = $140,000
Cash-on-Cash = -$15,900 / $140,000 = -11.4%
```

**3. House Hacking Adjusted Return:**
```
Housing Cost Savings = $2,800 - $1,965 = $835/month
Annual Savings = $835 × 12 = $10,020
Adjusted Annual Return = -$15,900 + $10,020 = -$5,880
Adjusted Cash-on-Cash = -$5,880 / $140,000 = -4.2%

Note: This doesn't include tax benefits, appreciation, or principal paydown
```
