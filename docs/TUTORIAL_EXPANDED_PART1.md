## 4. Understanding Investment Metrics {#metrics}

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

#### Cash Flow Analysis
Cash flow is the lifeblood of real estate investing. Here's how we calculate it:

**Monthly Cash Flow Formula:**
```
Monthly Cash Flow = Gross Rental Income - Total Monthly Expenses

Where Total Monthly Expenses include:
• Mortgage Payment (Principal + Interest)
• Property Taxes
• Insurance
• Property Management (8-12% of rent)
• Maintenance and Repairs (5-10% of rent)
• Vacancy Allowance (5-8% of rent)
• HOA Fees (if applicable)
```

**Example Calculation:**
```
Property: $500,000 purchase price
Down Payment: $100,000 (20%)
Loan Amount: $400,000 at 6.5% for 30 years

Monthly Rental Income: $2,800
Monthly Expenses:
• Mortgage Payment: $2,528
• Property Taxes: $417
• Insurance: $125
• Property Management: $280
• Maintenance: $140
• Vacancy: $140
• Total Expenses: $3,630

Monthly Cash Flow: $2,800 - $3,630 = -$830 (Negative!)
```

This property would require additional analysis or negotiation to become profitable.

#### Return on Investment (ROI) Metrics

**1. Cap Rate (Capitalization Rate)**
```
Cap Rate = Net Operating Income / Property Value

Example:
Annual NOI: $18,000
Property Value: $500,000
Cap Rate: $18,000 / $500,000 = 3.6%
```

**2. Cash-on-Cash Return**
```
Cash-on-Cash Return = Annual Cash Flow / Total Cash Invested

Example:
Annual Cash Flow: $6,000
Total Cash Invested: $120,000 (down payment + closing costs)
Cash-on-Cash Return: $6,000 / $120,000 = 5%
```

**3. Internal Rate of Return (IRR)**
IRR considers the time value of money and includes:
- Initial investment
- Annual cash flows
- Property appreciation
- Tax benefits
- Sale proceeds

**4. Return on Equity (ROE)**
```
ROE = Annual Cash Flow / Current Equity in Property

This metric helps determine when to refinance or sell.
```

### Risk Assessment Framework

#### Market Risk Factors
1. **Economic Indicators**:
   - Employment growth rate
   - Population trends
   - New construction permits
   - Average days on market

2. **Property-Specific Risks**:
   - Age and condition of property
   - Neighborhood crime rates
   - School district quality
   - Proximity to amenities

3. **Financial Risks**:
   - Interest rate sensitivity
   - Vacancy rates
   - Maintenance costs
   - Property tax increases

#### Risk Mitigation Strategies
1. **Diversification**: Spread investments across different:
   - Geographic locations
   - Property types
   - Price ranges
   - Tenant demographics

2. **Conservative Underwriting**:
   - Use higher vacancy rates (8-10%)
   - Budget for major repairs (10-15% of rent)
   - Maintain cash reserves (6 months expenses)

3. **Professional Management**:
   - Hire experienced property managers
   - Regular property inspections
   - Proactive maintenance programs

## 5. Basic Investment Strategies {#basic-strategies}

### Strategy 1: House Hacking

#### What is House Hacking?
House hacking involves purchasing a multi-unit property, living in one unit, and renting out the others. This strategy allows you to:
- Qualify for owner-occupied financing (lower down payments)
- Reduce or eliminate your housing costs
- Build equity while learning real estate investing

#### House Hacking Tutorial

**Step 1: Identify Suitable Properties**
Search criteria for house hacking:
```json
{
  "propertyType": ["Duplex", "Triplex", "Fourplex", "Single Family with ADU"],
  "ownerOccupancyRequired": true,
  "minUnits": 2,
  "maxUnits": 4,
  "strategy": "house_hacking"
}
```

**Step 2: Financial Analysis**
Calculate your effective housing cost:
```
Example: Duplex Purchase
Purchase Price: $450,000
Down Payment: $22,500 (5% FHA loan)
Monthly Mortgage: $2,850
Your Unit: 2BR/1BA
Rental Unit: 2BR/1BA at $1,400/month

Your Housing Cost: $2,850 - $1,400 = $1,450/month
vs. Renting Similar Unit: $2,200/month
Monthly Savings: $750
```

**Step 3: Property Selection Criteria**
Look for properties with:
- Separate entrances for privacy
- Similar unit sizes for easy management
- Good rental demand in the area
- Potential for value-add improvements

### Strategy 2: BRRRR Method

#### BRRRR Overview
Buy, Rehab, Rent, Refinance, Repeat - a strategy for scaling your portfolio:

1. **Buy**: Purchase undervalued properties
2. **Rehab**: Improve the property to increase value
3. **Rent**: Find quality tenants for cash flow
4. **Refinance**: Pull out invested capital
5. **Repeat**: Use recycled capital for next property

#### BRRRR Tutorial

**Step 1: Finding BRRRR Candidates**
Search for properties with:
- Below-market pricing
- Cosmetic renovation needs
- Strong rental demand
- Potential for 20%+ value increase

**Step 2: Renovation Planning**
Focus on high-impact improvements:
- Kitchen updates (new cabinets, countertops, appliances)
- Bathroom renovations
- Flooring replacement
- Fresh paint throughout
- Landscaping improvements

**Step 3: Financial Projections**
```
Example BRRRR Deal:
Purchase Price: $180,000
Renovation Costs: $30,000
Total Investment: $210,000

After Renovation Value (ARV): $260,000
Refinance at 75% LTV: $195,000
Cash Recovered: $195,000 - $210,000 = -$15,000

Monthly Rent: $2,100
Monthly Expenses: $1,400
Monthly Cash Flow: $700

Cash-on-Cash Return: $8,400 / $15,000 = 56%
```

### Strategy 3: Turnkey Rentals

#### Turnkey Investment Overview
Turnkey rentals are move-in ready properties that require minimal work before renting. Benefits include:
- Immediate cash flow
- Lower renovation risks
- Faster time to market
- Suitable for out-of-state investing

#### Turnkey Selection Process

**Step 1: Market Research**
Identify strong rental markets:
- Growing job markets
- Affordable housing costs
- Landlord-friendly laws
- Strong property management companies

**Step 2: Property Criteria**
Look for:
- Built after 1980
- Recent updates (roof, HVAC, plumbing)
- Move-in ready condition
- Existing tenant or high rental demand

**Step 3: Due Diligence Checklist**
- Professional property inspection
- Rent roll verification
- Market rent analysis
